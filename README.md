# Machine Learning–Based Skin Disease Classification System
This machine learning–based project predicts skin disease localization using structured clinical data. It applies data preprocessing, label encoding, and feature scaling, followed by an ANN model for multi-class classification. The system delivers accurate predictions to assist dermatologists in medical decision-making.
